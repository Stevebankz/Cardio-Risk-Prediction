# Heart Disease Prediction

ℹ️ This project focuses on predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly heart attacks, which account for four out of five CVD deaths according to the World Health Organization.

## Data Preparation

📊 The dataset used in this research is sourced from an ongoing cardiovascular study in Framingham, Massachusetts. The objective is to predict whether patients have a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset comprises over 4,000 records with 15 attributes containing patients' information.

📌 Feel free to explore further insights into the dataset to better understand the factors contributing to heart disease prediction using logistic regression.
